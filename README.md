# Random_Itinerary

Each collaborator will have their own branch, and the final product will be placed here.

Our project utilizes the Google places API to interact with location data and provide activities for users. The app will then administer randomly generated locations pertaining to a user's personally set itinerary which could include activities such as visiting restaurants, trails, trails, monuments, shops, and other recreational areas if so desired. A user's profile will be stored in a Firebase database and will contain old existing lists, user information, and any newly created lists. The user will also be asked to log in as a form of authentication and their email, username, and password will all be contained within a user's profile. Something to note is that the locations will be randomly selected within a vicinity around the user and certain options can be filtered out by the user if need be.
